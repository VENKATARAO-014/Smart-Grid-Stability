# Smart-Grid-Stability
To predict the Electrical Grid stability using the machine learning models.
Based on dataset features we have trained the model to predict stability and its accuracy.
The goal is to increase the accuracy with Hyperparameter (XGBoost) using ML models so that the prediction increase efficiency through grid optimization.
